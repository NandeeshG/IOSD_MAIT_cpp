    //The most simple algorithm to check if num is prime 
    //is to run a loop from 2 to num-1 and check if num
    //is divisible by any one of them. If not it is prime.
    //
    //To improve upon this, run loop till num/2 only, because
    //any number greater than num/2 will not divide num.
    //
    //An even better approach is to run loop untill 
    //square_root(num) only. and run loop as 3 to sqrt(num)
    //with each iteration skipping two. (obviously we'll 
    //check if number is even before running loop)
    //

    //better run times. Do lookup on the internet!

    //Q4
    //decimal codes are written in powers of 10
    //234 = 2*pow(10,2) + 3*pow(10,1) + 4*pow(10,0)
    //
    //similarly, binary codes are written in powers of 2.
    //11101010 = 1*pow(2,7) + 1*pow(2,6) + 1*pow(2,5) +
    //           0*pow(2,4) + 1*pow(2,3) + 0*pow(2,2) +
    //           1*pow(2,1) + 0*pow(2,0) = 234(in decimal)
    //
    //base of decimal is 10 (0 to 9)
    //base of binary is 2   (0 to 1)
    //base of octal is 8    (0 to 7)
    //base of hexadecimal is 16 (0 to 9 then a,b,c,d,e,f)
    //
    //in Computer science, we may put 0b infront 
    //of binary to tell it is binary code. (doesn't work in c++ though)
    //0x in front of hexa to tell to interpret following

    //Q10
    //Number of trailing zeroes in 100! is 24
    //we found this out by repeated factor division
    //refer this please 
    // http://www.mytechinterviews.com/how-many-trailing-zeros-in-100-factorial
    // This gives number of zeroes as 24
    // now when we subtract 1, all the zeroes become niners
    // Thus final answer for the question is 0
    //------------------------------------------
    

    //------------------------------------------
    //Q11
    //I can think of two ways to solve this.
    //1) Use XOR
    //2) Use sum
    //
    //1) Repeatedly XOR every element in two arrays as
    //the user inputs them. At the end only the unique
    //element will remain. This is because (a)XOR(a) = 0
    //and (0)XOR(b) = b
    //Thus, in a sense, every repeating element will cancel
    //itself and the unique element will be left remaining.
    //I hope you get this.
    //
    //2) This is pretty easy way. Calculate the sum of both
    //arrays. Subtract sum of smaller array, from that of 
    //larger one. This will leave only the unique element.
    //
    //I have implemented the XOR code here
    int size,temp;
    cout<<"Enter size of array for XOR question. ";
    cin>>size;
    int unique=0;
    cout<<"Enter elements of the two arrays. ";
    for(int i=0; i<(2*n+1); ++i)
    {
        cin>>temp;
        unique = unique ^ temp;
        //shorthand will be -> unique^=temp;
    }
    cout<<"Unique is "<<unique<<endl;
